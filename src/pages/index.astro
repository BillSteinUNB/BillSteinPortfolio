      <p>I have done extensive work in Java, starting with the basics of learning OOP, making small programs such as login databases and GUI's. Doing extensive algorithm work and 
        analysis in such fields. I am currently working on a 2 full scale programs which will eventually be live. These being a weight-tracking app for managing and graphing your weight overtime, this will involve
        a full login system and a few algorithms working on user input. The second being a
