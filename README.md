<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

My primary goal in this project was to create a centralized platform to showcase my best work, while simultaneously providing an opportunity for learning, experimentation, and the ability to build something from scratch. Being able to select features to deploy and learn how to develop them from the ground up has been an incredibly rewarding experience.
